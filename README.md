> All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are embedded in a single file for simplicity and portability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5

- Chart.js (for data visualization)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Events are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence between sessions.
- Calendar dynamically renders based on the current week and allows navigation between weeks.
- Notifications check every minute for upcoming events and notify users if one is starting soon.
- All UI elements are interactive and mobile-friendly.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Start managing your events right away — no server or installation needed!

## 🧩 Customization Ideas

- Integrate Google Calendar or external APIs.
- Add user authentication for multi-user access.
- Export/Import events as `.ics` or JSON files.
